#Plant Disease Detection


solutions={"0 Apple Scab": "Apple scab is a common disease of plants in the rose family (Rosaceae) that is caused by the ascomycete fungus Venturia inaequalis. While this disease affects several plant genera including Sorbus, Cotoneaster,and Pyrus, it is most commonly associated with the infection of Malus trees, including species of flowering crabapple, as well as cultivated apple. The first symptoms of this disease are found in the foliage, blossoms, and developing fruits of affected trees, which develop dark, irregularly-shaped lesions upon infection. Although apple scab rarely kills its host, infection typically leads to fruit deformation and premature leaf and fruit drop, which enhance the susceptibility of the host plant to abiotic stress and secondary infection. The reduction of fruit quality and yield may result in crop losses of up to 70%, posing a significant threat to the profitability of apple producers. To reduce scab-related yield losses, growers often combine preventive practices, including sanitation and resistance breeding, with reactive measures, such as targeted fungicide or biocontrol treatments, to prevent the incidence and spread of apple scab in their crops.Remove and destroy the fallen leaf litter so that the fungus cannot overwinter. ...Do not overcrowd plants, and make sure the canopy has proper airflow. Fungicide applications at 2-week intervals beginning when new growth is expanding in the spring .The best fungicides available for scab control at this time of the early season are the broad-spectrum protectants: Captan and the EBDCs.",
           "1 Apple Black rot": "Black rot is caused by the fungus Diplodia seriata (syn Botryosphaeria obtusa). The fungus can infect dead tissue as well as living trunks, branches, leaves and fruits. The black rot fungi survive Minnesota winters in branch cankers and mummified fruit (shriveled and dried fruit) attached to the tree.Mancozeb, and Ziram are all highly effective against black rot. Because these fungicides are strictly protectants, they must be applied before the fungus infects or enters the plant. They protect fruit and foliage by preventing spore germination. They will not arrest lesion development after infection has occurred.",
           "2 Apple Cedar Apple rust": "These diseases require plants from two different families in order to complete their life cycle; one plant from the Cupressaceae family (red cedar, juniper) and the other from the Rosaceae family (crabapple, hawthorn, serviceberry). Symptoms are very different on each type of plant.Fungicides with the active ingredient Myclobutanil are most effective in preventing rust. ...Fungicides are only effective if applied before leaf spots or fruit infection appear.Spray trees and shrubs when flower buds first emerge until spring weather becomes consistently warm and dry.Monitor nearby junipers.",

           "4 Cherry healthy": "The Cherry Plant is healthy.",
           "5 Cherry Including Sour Powdery Mildew": "Powdery mildew of sweet and sour cherry is caused by Podosphaera clandestina, an obligate biotrophic fungus. Mid- and late-season sweet cherry (Prunus avium) cultivars are commonly affected, rendering them unmarketable due to the covering of white fungal growth on the cherry surface (Fig. 1).You have a choice of low toxicity fungicides like horticultural oils. These include jojoba oil, neem oil, and brand name spray oils designed for fruit trees. Classic fungicides that are used against apple scab, such as sterol inhibitors, are highly effective at controlling powdery mildew.Powdery mildew rarely causes serious damage to its host, but infection by the fungus can discolor leaves, causing those leaves to die and/or drop. Powdery mildew can also infect, disfigure and deform shoots and flowers ",
